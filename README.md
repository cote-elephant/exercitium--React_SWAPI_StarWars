# React Star Wars Project

The **React Star Wars** project is a beginner-friendly application designed to learn React and API integration. It uses the [Star Wars API (SWAPI)](https://swapi.dev/) to fetch and display data about movies, characters, and planets from the Star Wars universe.

## Features

### Pages
- **Movies Page**: Displays a list of Star Wars movies with details like title, release date, and director.
- **Characters Page**: Showcases Star Wars characters, their species, and home planets.
- **Planets Page**: A simple list of Star Wars planets (mock data or another API).

### Core Concepts
- **API Integration**: Learn how to fetch and manage external data using React hooks like `useEffect` and `useState`.
- **Routing**: Use `react-router-dom` to navigate between pages seamlessly.

This project is perfect for mastering React basics while exploring Star Wars lore! ðŸš€
